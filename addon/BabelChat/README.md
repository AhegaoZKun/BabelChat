# BabelChat

Chat in a language you don't read, translated where you're already looking.

## On its own

Install it and play. Nothing to configure, no account, no key.

Gaming terms get their meaning appended in grey on the same line:

```
wtb gilded crest, cod    wtb = Куплю · gilded = Золочёная эмблема · crest = Эмблема +1
```

**383 terms in 14 languages**, plus every zone and item-set name from LibBabble.
The language comes from your WoW client, so a Russian client glosses in Russian.

## With the companion app

For whole sentences rather than terms, run the free companion app from
<https://github.com/Yumash/BabelChat>. It reads this addon's chat buffer and
shows translations in an overlay above WoW — read-only, no injection, no
automation.

While the app is running the addon stays quiet, so the same message is not
answered twice in different words. Turn on "show the gloss even when the app is
running" in `/babel config` if you want both.

## Commands

## Credits

The glossary began as [WoW Translator](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/wow-translator)
by **Pirson** (MIT), which contributed 314 terms across 14 languages. BabelChat
added slang and a current Endgame/Midnight set, rewrote the matching engine, and
built the companion app.

- **Andrey Yumashev** — addon, companion app, translation engine
- **AhegaoZKun** — Linux/Wayland support, Microsoft Translator backend
